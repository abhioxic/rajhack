# O-Mitra: Offline Mitra

*O-Mitra is an new and unique concept designed to solve the most imminent problem of rural India. We propose an application system that can provide various government services to the people in need without relying on the internet. The app will provide various information and services in an up-to-date on demand manner with an intuitive interface usable to anyone from anywhere with any network. Connecting millions of people to the Government and making the work of Government easy and transparent.*

## Prelude
 Internet, the driving force behind the cutting edge technologies like AI, ML and our facebook, has become a vital part of our urban life. However, the reality is that for majority of indians living in the rural area, it is a privilege they do not have. According to one report of December 2017, Internet penetration in rural india (*833+ million people*) is just **20.26%!** Unknowingly we are creating a huge technological gap because we are forgetting our feeding hands, our farmers and our sheperds. 

 What if this gap can be removed? *We propose an application system that can provide various government services to the people in need without relying on the internet. The app will provide all information and services in an up-to-date, on demand manner with an intuitive interface usable to anyone from anywhere with any network. Connecting millions of people to the Government and making the work of Government easy and transparent.

 So imagine an app that can provide various government services, like **everyday with daily newspaper you will also get daily mandi rate**, or easily set an **appointment** with the soil tester automatically, or get **information** about various schemes and yojanas, in a single place, with a beautiful UI, all working ***without using internet*** that too free of cost in a secure manner, which can be used to actually make the life of rural people, and the Government, a lot better.

## Key Points
  - Fully works without using internet
  - Up-to-date, fetches information from data hub.
  - Easy to use UI, hides all the complexity of behind the scenes
  - Accessibilty, to the rich services and schemes of the Government
